# Working of the code 

### Retrieval and Generation:
It involves two main processes:

- **Retrieval**: This is like using a search engine to find information related to a specific question or topic. The system looks through a lot of data (like articles, books, or other documents) to find pieces that are relevant.

- **Generation**: Once the system has the relevant information, it uses that to write or generate a response, much like composing an email or message based on the information you have.

### How the system approximates RAG:

#### This application’s process:

- **Upload and Read PDF**: Imagine if someone gave you a book and asked you to summarize it. The first thing you do is read the book. Similarly, your application takes a PDF file, reads it, and extracts all the text.
- **Find Relevant Information**: After reading the book, you need to remember or look up related information to help make a better summary. The application does this by looking through a pre-prepared list of texts (corpus) to find any content that matches keywords from the PDF. It’s like searching your own notes to see if there’s anything related.
- **Generate Summary**: With all this information, you then try to write a summary. The application does this by sending both the text from the PDF and the additional related text it found to a powerful computer program (like GPT-3.5 Turbo), which then writes a summary.

### Simplification with analogies:
- **Kitchen Recipe Analogy**: Compare it to cooking where you first gather all the ingredients you need (retrieval) and then cook them to make a dish (generation).

### Emphasize the Learning Aspect:
- **Learning and Improving**: Thi is a demo system and it doesn’t learn and adapt yet, real RAG systems can improve over time. They learn from new data and feedback, just like a student learns from studying more or a chef improves by cooking more dishes.

### Working of the demo:

**The uploaded PDF is about climate change impacts, and it contains phrases like "rising temperatures" and "changing weather patterns".** The retrieval function might find related content in your corpus, such as the paragraph on climate change. This would be combined with the PDF text and sent to the OpenAI API.



**Expected Final Output**: A summary that not only reflects the content of the PDF but also integrates insights from the retrieved paragraph about climate change. This summary might include a broader context or linkages, like explaining the long-term effects of these patterns, which the original PDF might not explicitly state.
